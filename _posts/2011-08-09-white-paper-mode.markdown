title: White Paper Mode
---
I've redesigned my blog to look like a white paper. I got tired of using the old stock Lightword theme. It particularly lost my interest when I saw another tech related blog using the same theme.

It has also been a very long time since I posted anything, and I decided to do a revamp to get back into the swing of blogging.

I've since taken on a new position at TravelPod at the office in Ottawa, Canada. It's given me a chance to shift my focus from the client based web development world to that of the product optimization one. With that I have gotten myself neck deep in the world of Perl, SEO and chart reading. It has thus far been fascinating.

Since I've been learning Perl, I also took a dive into Python â€“ sort of just for fun and particularly at the recommendation of Eric S Raymond.

I wrote a small Python program that is essentially fed emails from a postfix / procmail set up and then sizes and thumbnails any images and posts them to a web page.

I will detail the set up in a later post.
