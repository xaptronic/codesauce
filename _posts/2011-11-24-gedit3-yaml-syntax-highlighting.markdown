title: gedit 3 Yaml Syntax Highlighting
---

I recently up(dated|graded) to Linux Mint 12 and have been running through Google on various issues to get myself up to the point of productivity that I had reached with the beloved Linux Mint 10.

[Just wanted to share a quick tip regarding YAML syntax highlighting in gedit3.](http://zoomquiet.org/res/scrapbook/ZqFLOSS/data/20110323184217/index.html)

This language spec appears to be for gedit2 but it does in fact work in gedit3. So all you YAML lovers (Perl, Symfony .. Ruby still using it?) bathe in the wonderful that is YAML syntax highlighting in gedit3 ( look at that SEOd sentence ).
